# GameBoy Game Link Cable Protocol
This repository contains some sample data from Game Link function from some GameBoy games. All data was captured using an Logical Analyser.

All data is in RAW data.

All data was captured using [this device](https://pt.aliexpress.com/item/4000190740610.html) and the [Saleae Logic 1.x](https://support.saleae.com/logic-software/legacy-software/older-software-releases#logic-1-x-download-links) software (it's possible to use the [2.x version](https://www.saleae.com/pt/downloads/), but needs to capture all samples again)
