A simple repository that contains some sample data from some GameBoy games captured using an Logical Analyser.

All data is in RAW data.

All data was captured using [this device](https://pt.aliexpress.com/item/4000190740610.html) and the Saleae Logic 1.x (but it's possible to use the 2.x version, but needs to capture all sample again)
