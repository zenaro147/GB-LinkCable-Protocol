# GameBoy Link Cable Protocol
A simple repository that contains some sample data from some GameBoy games captured using an Logical Analyser.

All data is in RAW data.

All data was captured using [this device](https://pt.aliexpress.com/item/4000190740610.html) and the [Saleae Logic 1.x](https://support.saleae.com/logic-software/legacy-software/older-software-releases#logic-1-x-download-links) (it's possible to use the [2.x version](https://www.saleae.com/pt/downloads/), but needs to capture all sample again)
